# Intrusion Detection System in C Programming Language

## This is a project showcasing my skills in working with **Network Protocols** and also handling **Multithreading** to exponentially increase the speed.

### Main points of the Program:
- Packet parsing using the libcap library
- Each packet is put into the thread queue
- Each packet header is processed to identify any potenial patterns to indicate threat

### Threats that are detected:
1. Blacklisted URLS
2. ARP Cache Poisoning
3. SYN Flooding Attack
